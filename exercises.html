				              JavaScript is a programming language developed in the late 1990s by Netscape. Microsoft said no.

				            <p class="exercise_box_details">
				              It's similar to most other programming languages, variables, loops, logic, functions. The difference is the browser engine.

				            <p class="exercise_box_details">
				              Modern browsers let you practice JavaScript inside the browser in real time. How is this different from a language like C++?

				            <p class="exercise_box_details">
				              JavaScript is still compiled, but it is compiled in the browser by the browser's JavaScript engine.

				            <p class="exercise_box_details">

				            <p class="exercise_box_details">
				              So we can create these variables, but that's useless unless we add a little logic into it. Let's start with 'if', 'else' statements.
				            </p>
				            
				            <p class="exercise_box_details">
				              <ol>
				              	<li>'If' statements let you run some code based on whether or not some condition passes. Here's the syntax:
				              		<pre class="visible">if( SOME CONDITION TO CHECK ) { <br/>    CODE TO RUN IF CONDITION PASSES <br>} </pre>
				              		<p>Here's an example: </p>
				              		<pre class="visible">var oldLadyIsSinging = 1;<br/><br/>if( oldLadyIsSinging ) {<br/>    var itIsOver = 1;<br/>}</pre>
				              	</li><br>
				              	<li>What if we only want something to happen if the 'if' condition fails? 'Else' statements!
				              		<pre class="visible">var oldLadyIsSinging = 1;<br/><br/>if( oldLadyIsSinging ) {<br/>    var itIsOver = 1;<br/>} else {<br/>    var itIsOver = 0;<br/>}</pre>
				              	</li><br>
				              	<li>We've secretly just introduced a NEW data type, BOOLEANS! Booleans are a data type that can only ever have 1 of 2 different values, true or false. Booleans are used in 'if' statements and loops. Here's a few examples of Booleans:
				              		
				              		<pre class="visible">true</pre>
				              		<pre class="visible">false</pre>
				              		<p>In addition to those two, comparison expressions can be evaluated as a boolean. Try putting these in your console and see what you get:
				              			<pre>10 > 5</pre>
				              			<pre>10 > 15</pre>
				              			<pre>var myNameString = "My name is Josh Soileau";<br/>myNameString === "My name is Josh Soileau"</pre>
				              			<pre>var myNameString = 123456;<br/>myNameString === "My name is Josh Soileau"</pre>
				              		</p>
				              	</li><br>
				              	<li>All of these examples of booleans can be used inside an if statement as the condition to check!</li><br>
				              	<li>PROMPT exercise. To be explained in class!</li>
				              </ol>

				            <h2> Arrays </h2>
				            				            
				            <p class="exercise_box_details">
				              Let's learn about yet another data type in JavaScript: arrays. Arrays are one of the most useful things in JavaScript, they let you organize things in groups.
				            </p>
				            
				            <p class="exercise_box_details">
				              <ol>
				              	<li>Arrays are defined by square brackets []. When the compiler sees those square brackets, it knows to expect an array of items inside the brackets.
				              		<pre class="visible">[ ARRAY ITEMS GO IN HERE ]</pre>
				              	</li><br>
				              	<li>The items inside the brackets are all separated by commas, to signify the dividers to the compiler.
				              		<pre class="visible">[ arrayItem, anotherArrayItem, yetAnotherArrayItem ]</pre>
				              		In the above case we have an array of size 3.
				              	</li><br>
				              	<li>Create an array of strings. Make it have at least 4 items in it, and make each item be your favorite topping on a pizza. Save that array to a variable.
				              		<pre>var pizzaTopings = [ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ];</pre>
				              	</li><br>
				              	<li>Okay, so we now have an array with values in it. How do we get those values later? We can access arrays using INDEXES</li><br>
				              	<li>What are indexes? They are slots in the array! But the secret is that the first slot of the array is index "0" (like all things comp sci). <!-- (insert explanation of starting at 0 and not 1). --> 
Think of it this way:
									<pre class="visible">[ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ]<br/><br/>   Index 0    Index 1        Index 2         Index 3        Index 4</pre>
								</li><br>
								<li>So the way we access indexes of the array are by using indexes in the array. Here's the syntax:
									<pre class="visible">var pizzaTopings = [ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ];<br/>pizzaToppings[ NUMBER OF INDEX I WANT TO ACCESS ]</pre>
								</li><br>
								<li>To get the first index of the array we would use the 0th index.
									<pre class="visible">var pizzaTopings = [ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ];<br>pizzaToppings[0];</pre>
								</li><br>
								<li>To get the third index of the array we would use the 2nd index.
									<pre class="visible">var pizzaTopings = [ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ];<br>pizzaToppings[2];</pre>
								</li><br>
								<li>How do we get the last item in the array? In this case we know it's the 4th index.
									<pre class="visible">var pizzaTopings = [ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ];<br>pizzaToppings[4];</pre>
									But what if we didn't know how long our array was? What if somebody inserts a 6th item in the array without us knowing?
									You can learn how long an array is by calling ".length" on it like this:
									<pre class="visible">[ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ].length</pre>
									Which is the same thing as saying:
									<pre class="visible">var pizzaTopings = [ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ];<br/>pizzaToppings.length</pre>
									Notice how it returns the number "5". But our last index is index #4! So to get the last element in the array, we could do this:
									<pre class="visible">var pizzaTopings = [ "Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Green Peppers", "Red Peppers", "Mushrooms" ];<br/><br/>pizzaToppings[ pizzaToppings.length - 1 ];</pre>
								</li><br>
								<li>It's important to note that arrays don't have to hold just 1 type of data. You can have an array of anything!
									<pre class="visible">[ "Cheese", 42, 999 ]<br>[ "Rocky", true, false, "Bullwinkle" ]</pre>
									You can even have an array of arrays!
									<pre class="visible">[ [12, 32], ["Cherry", "Vanilla", false] ]</pre>
								</li>

				            <p class="exercise_box_details">
				              Sometimes you want to run the same bit of code over and over again. There are a couple of ways to do that in JavaScript, we are going to start with For loops!
				            </p>
				            
				            <p class="exercise_box_details">
				              <ol>
				              	<li>For loops are similar to if statements. You have some parenthesis and some curly braces. The code inside the curly braces is the code that runs during the loop. Here's the syntax:
				              	<pre class="visible">for( BEFORE CODE ; WHILE CONDITION ; AFTER CODE ) {<br/>    CODE TO BE RUN DURING LOOP <br/>}<br/><br/>BEFORE CODE: this is set at the beginning of the loop<br>It is usually something like var i=0 or something like that<br/><br/>WHILE CONDITION: the condition to keep running the loop<br/><br/>AFTER CODE: this runs after every iteration of the loop</pre>
				              	</li><br>

				              	At the top, we create two variables, one isn't defined yet (i), the other is an empty string. The loop starts at i = 0, and loops through as long as i < 6, but increasing i by 1 every time the loop finishes.
				              	The code inside the loop takes our empty string, and appends a number on the back of it every time the loop happens (remember what happens when you add a string and a number together?)

				            <h2> All About Functions </h2>
				            				            
				            <p class="exercise_box_details">
				              Sometimes in programming we have to repeat ourselves multiple times. When it comes to that kind of thing, we have a rule in programming. It's called D.R.Y., DON'T REPEAT YOURSELVES. Luckily, in programming, we have a concept called functions that let us perform repetetive behaviors in a simple way.
				            </p>
				            
				            <p class="exercise_box_details">
				              <ol>
				              	<li>Let's take a common use case. We want print out to a greeting to the user. If you did that without a function you would do something like this:
				              	<pre class="visible">var userName = "Josh Soileau";
console.log("Hello, " + userName);
console.log("It's nice to see you today.");
console.log("Looks like you've got a lot on your plate today.");
console.log("Better get to work!");</pre>
				              	</li><br>
				              	<li>But if you had different userNames, you'd have to do all 5 lines over and over again for every user. Or, we could just use a function! Here's the function syntax:
				              	<pre class="visible">
var myFunctionName = function( PARAMETER TO GIVE THE FUNCTION ) {
  CODE INSIDE THE FUNCTION
};
                  </pre>
				              	So then, whenever you wanted to run "CODE INSIDE THE FUNCTION", you would just call the function like this:
				              	<pre class="visible">
myFunctionName( SOME PARAMETER I WANT TO PASS );
                  </pre>
				              	I know that can be confusing, let's see an example.
								Here's the code we had before, but this time in function form!
								<pre class="visible">
var greetTheUser = function( userName ) {
  console.log("Hello, " + userName);
  console.log("It's nice to see you today.");
  console.log("Looks like you've got a lot on your plate today.");
  console.log("Better get to work!");
};
                  </pre>
								IMPORTANT NOTE: Just writing that code out WILL NOT RUN that code. 
								All we did in that code was tell the computer "If anyone ever calls the function 'greetTheUser', do this code right here".
								To actually run the code, we have to "call" it, like this:
								<pre class="visible">
greetTheUser( "Josh Soileau" );
                  </pre>
				              	</li><br>
				              	<li>
				              	So what is the thing inside of our call to greetTheUser()?
								That is our "parameter".
								Functions work a bit like machines, you give them SOMETHING, and they do things with it!
								In this case, we are "giving" our greetTheUser function a string called "Josh Soileau".
								Let's look at our function again:
								<pre class="visible">
var greetTheUser = function( userName ) {
  console.log("Hello, " + userName);
  console.log("It's nice to see you today.");
  console.log("Looks like you've got a lot on your plate today.");
  console.log("Better get to work!");
};
                  </pre>		
								As you see, our function expects to be passed something (as you can see because there is a variable inside the parenthesis of the function declaration).
								We are saying that the greetTheUser function expects to be called and passed an argument, and we are going to call that argument 'userName'.
								The function doesn't know WHAT it is being passed, just that it is being passed SOMETHING.
								Exercise: Try calling the function with a different data type, like a number, array, or object.
								<pre>
greetTheUser( 12.34 );
greetTheUser( "HAL" );
                  </pre>
								As you can see, it treats it the same way! It saves whatever it is being passed into this 'userName' variable, and tries to use it as well as it can.
				              	</li><br>
				              	<li>
				              	Functions can also return values that we can save for later. See this example:
				              	<pre class="visible">
var timesTwo = function(number) {
    return number * 2;
};

var thisShouldEqualFourteen = timesTwo( 7 );
                  </pre>
				              	The above function expects to receive a number, does some math, and gives back a new number.
								We can save the result in a variable. Super useful!
				              	</li>
				              </ol>
				            </p>
				            
				          </div>

				            <h2> All About Scope! </h2>
				            				            
				            <p class="exercise_box_details">
				              Lets take a look at a concept called "scoping".
				            </p>
				            
				            <ol>
				            	<li>Here's our previous function:
				            	<pre class="visible">
var greetTheUser = function( userName ) {
  console.log("Hello, " + userName);
  console.log("It's nice to see you today.");
  console.log("Looks like you've got a lot on your plate today.");
  console.log("Better get to work!");
};
                  </pre>
				            	</li><br>
				            	<li>Inside this function we make a variable called "userName". What happens if we try and access that variable somewhere else, like this:
				            	 <pre class="visible">
var greetTheUser = function( userName ) {
  console.log("Hello, " + userName);
  console.log("It's nice to see you today.");
  console.log("Looks like you've got a lot on your plate today.");
  console.log("Better get to work!");
};

console.log( userName );
                  </pre>
				            	What do we get there and why?
								In JavaScript, variables (and functions) are only available in the context they are defined in.
				            	</li><br>
				            	<li>
				            	Think of scoping like each bit of code is a small piece of a neighborhood.
								Each "function" is a fenced in property. Anything on the inside, stays in the inside.
								In our example above, the "userName" variable is created inside our fenced in yard.
								But then we try and use that variable OUTSIDE of the fence, and it doesn't work. That is because OUTSIDE of the fence, we don't know what "userName" is, it is undefined!
				            	</li><br>
				            	<li>The same thing will happen here as well:
				            	<pre class="visible">
var prepareForUser = function( userName ) {
  var greetingString = "Hello, " + userName;
  var userAge = 54;
  var userFavoriteColor = "Beige";
};

// ALWAYS REMEMBER TO CALL YOUR FUNCTION!
// Otherwise, the code inside it won't run! 
prepareForUser( "Josh Soileau" );

console.log( greetingString );
console.log( "Your age is " + userAge );
console.log( "Your favorite color is " + userFavoriteColor );
                  </pre>
				            	</li><br>
				            	<li>
				            	So how do we fix that code above??
								Remember how our code is kind of like a neighborhood with fences in it?
								Well, if we create a variable OUTSIDE of ALL of the fences, then that variable is available everywhere, even INSIDE the fences.
								That is called a variable being "global". Let's look at an example:
								<pre class="visible">
var wildNeighborhoodDog = "Fido";
var dogIsFarAway = 1;

var callDog = function( dogName ) {

  if( dogIsFarAway ) {
    console.log( "Here, " + dogName + ", here boy!" );
  } else {
    console.log( "Good boy, " + dogName );
  }

};

callDog( wildNeighborhoodDog );
                  </pre>
								Because our "wildNeighborhoodDog" and "dogIsFarAway" variables are GLOBAL, we can use them inside our "callDog" function.
								Let's try and fix our code from before. We can solve our problem by making the variables global, like this:
								   <pre class="visible">
var greetingString;
var userAge;
var userFavoriteColor;

var prepareForUser = function( userName ) {
  greetingString = "Hello, " + userName;
  userAge = 54;
  userFavoriteColor = "Beige";
};

// ALWAYS REMEMBER TO CALL YOUR FUNCTION!
// Otherwise, the code inside it won't run! 
prepareForUser( "Josh Soileau" );

console.log( greetingString );
console.log( "Your age is " + userAge );
console.log( "Your favorite color is " + userFavoriteColor );
                  </pre>
								All we had to do is DECLARE our variables globally. We didn't even need to assign them any value.
								Just the act of declaring them outside the function meant that we could access them outside the function later on.
				            	</li><br>
				            	<li>Now we know that we can make variables GLOBAL and have access to them everywhere. So why don't we do this for everything??
				            	Take a look at this code below, tell me what the output is:
				            	<pre class="visible">
var numberOfBalloons = 99;
var balloonsColor = "Red";

var popOneBalloon = function( balloonsColor ) {

  numberOfBalloons = numberOfBalloons - 1;
  var balloonsColor = "Blue";

};

console.log( numberOfBalloons + " " +  balloonsColor + " balloons go by." );
                  </pre>
				            	What is the output of that code and why? (move the console.log around to learn more)
				            	</li><br>
				            	<li>This type of thing is why it's a bad idea to have too many global variables. By saying that YOUR variable is global, you are effectively preventing other coders from using that variable name in different scopes. If you can, try and do without global variables.</li>

									Declare your variables at the TOP of your file.</li><br>
				              	<li>First thing's first. Create a function called printAccountInfo that will print the information for this user's account using console.log.
									It may be helpful, as well, to create a printBalance function that will ONLY print the balance and not the rest of the info.</li><br>
				              	<li>After we have the our printAccountInfo function, we need functions to manage our balance.

				              		Important note: this function DOES NOT CHANGE the balance, it just predicts what the balance will be after X number of years at 3% interest.
				              		
				              		Another important note: this can be accomplished a few different ways (like everything in programming). It can be done with for loops, while loops, you can even do it with recursive functions if you want to get elegant.

				              This is where you get your feet wet with objects. Objects are everywhere in JS. They are an additional datatype, like Number and Array. In fact, they are quite similar to arrays in that they are multiple, multidimensional data stores and can contain any type of data. You can have an objet of objects, and object of arrays, etc.

				              The fundamental difference between objects and arrays is their construction as key/value pairs.

The elements you write, the attributes in your elements and the text inside your elements are all nested together neatly in your HTML. The browser translates this structure into the page as a hierarchy of nodes and relationships. This is the DOM. It is simply a representation of the constructed web page itself, mapped to a hierarchical tree. Think of it as a map. The HTML you write is parsed by the browser and becomes the DOM. The DOM is the foundation of the page you see.

				              Okay, great. We have the DOM. So what? The browser downloads your HTML, styles are applied, images and fonts loaded. Without a line of JavaScript, the DOM exists and a polished web page gets painted to my browser. What good is JavaScript?

				              	<pre class="visible">

                  				The API also provides document.getElementsByClassName() which also returns an array but takes — you guessed it! — a class name as its parameter. 
                  				
                  				More recently, browser developers have included the document.querySelector() method, which takes a CSS selector, just like jQuery. Try this one in the CodePen:
                  				
                  				<pre class="visible">
var theHeader = document.querySelector('#the-title');
theHeader.innerHTML = 'This works with id, class and tag name. It selects the first instance of a match.'
                  </pre>
                  				The API also provides document.querySelectorAll() which returns multiples. MDN does a good job documenting the API <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.querySelectorAll">here</a>.

                  				This is an absolutely convoluted example. But hopefully, you can see how we can loop through elements and check their classes. But you an also see how difficult it is to something as simple as check which classes belong to an element. jQuery made this process infinitely easier. And more complex processes, like traversing the DOM, were also made MUCH easier. If we have time, we'll look a bit at what jQuery can do.

				            <p class="exercise_box_details">
				              What is animation? On the screen, it's movement of some element over time. Basic animation is rather simple. In this exercise, we'll be applying a background image to a div and change the background's x (left/horizontal) position over time. You'll be introduced to the setTimeout function which repeatedly calls a function after a specified delay. Each time we run the function with setTimeout, we'll pull the background image position slightly to the left. It'll happen so quickly, it will look like animation.

				            <p class="exercise_box_details">
				              Events are generally triggers for some behavior to occur. This could be a mouse click on an element, the page itself loading, an image loading, the user entering a form field, a keystroke, etc. When an event occurs, the browser fires an event handler function that executes a piece of code. Let's dive in starting with our cloud animation.

				              <ol>
				              	<li>So now we're simply going to create a function we want the event to call, and we're going to wire up the event itself. Events are incredibly powerful. You can probably see where we're going with this.

				              We might not have time to work this out in class. If you're having fun with this — and I'm sure you are ‐ then finish it at home. Let's build a slideshow of images. Let's keep it simple. We want three images of the same width and height to animate when you click on some previous and next buttons.
				            </p>
				            
				            <p class="exercise_box_details">
				              What are the components of a slideshow, or carousel? We already listed some. We need images. We need buttons or links to which we wire up events. We need an outer container that will hide everything but the current image. We need an inner container that will be wide enough for our images to sit side-by-side-by-side.
				            </p>
				            
				            <p class="exercise_box_details">
				              In the JavaScript, we need an animation function that sends the images left and right. We need to track where we are in the slideshow. We need events to call the animation function and tell the slide tracker what's going on. Finally, we need to handle shuffling the slides so that one slide is always to the left and right of the current slide.
				            </p>
				            
				            <p class="exercise_box_details">
				              It's probably also a good idea to only allow one click to be processed until the current cycle finishes running. How do we wire this all together?
